# Esp32-C6-Bug-Arduino-Examples
Hello Internet traveller!
You have just arrived to the repository containing Arduino code examples for Esp32-C6-Bug.
## Arduino IDE support
The official Arduino support for the Esp32-C6 chip is now ready (check out arduino-esp32 version 3.0.0). To install it you should insert index.json link(Stable -https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_index.json or Development (Supports Esp32-C6 as of 5.2.2024) - https://espressif.github.io/arduino-esp32/package_esp32_dev_index.json)  from https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html
Into the preferences tab of Arduino IDE. After it's done the core will be available to download via Boards Manager.
Some examples are covered more in details in [Esp32-C6-Bug datasheet](https://github.com/allexoK/Esp32-C6-Bug-Docs/blob/main/esp32c6bugdatasheet.pdf)
When compiling the examples ensure that:
- The Board option in tools tab is set to 'ESP32C6 Dev Module'
- USB CDC On Boot option in tools tab is set to 'True'
- Port option in tools tab is set to the port, where you connected your board.
## Quick examples description
- esp32c6bugblink - The first example demonstrates the basic blinking functionality, nothing fancy, but a good way to start. 
    - Parts needed:
        - Esp32-C6-Bug
- esp32c6bugethernet - The second example utizes the Ethernet to connect to the Internet, use it to ensure that Esp32-Bug-Eth is working.
    - Parts needed:
        - Esp32-C6-Bug
        - Esp32-Bug-Eth
- esp32c6bugplusSH1106_128x64_i2c_QTPY - For this example, you will need some kind of OLED display based around SH1106 driver. If it has Stemma QT connector you can connect it to Esp32-Bug-Eth via it(Alternatively just connect display SDA->pin 21, display SCL->pin 20). The code prints basic 'hello world' style message.  
    - Parts needed:
        - Esp32-C6-Bug
        - Some Oled with SH1106 driver
        - optional: Esp32-Bug-Eth
- esp32c6bugethernetbmp280telegrambot - This example is more advanced and more 'open-ended', but is my personal favorite. It uses Ethernet to connect to the Internet, reads data from BMP280 sensor(you can later replace it with any other sensor/combination of sensors) and sends it to you via Telegram messenger if the data exceeds some limit(temperature range 20-30 Â°C). You can follow [this](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/telegram-control-esp32-esp8266-nodemcu-outputs/) tutorial to get Telegram token and Chat ID defines in code.
I personally love this example, because I see it as a stepping stone to some interesting experiments. Imagine a group of sensors 'writing' data to a Telegram chat and an AI like ChatGPT reading the sensor data from the chat and commanding some other IoT devices to perform actions!(Like issuing 'open the window command' via the same chat) Can it handle the data like this? Will it open the window if the temperature is too hot? What is the maximum amount of 'inputs' and 'outputs' it can handle? Noone knows since the technology is quite new, maybe you will be the first person to find out?
    - Parts needed:
        - Esp32-C6-Bug
        - BMP280 sensor(Something with Stemma QT works best)
        - Esp32-Bug-Eth
